# 04-2D-Plaformer
This is a 2d platformer made for the MSCH c220 class at IUB 

This was made using the base of the assignments for the class. I tried to make it similar to the difficult games with no checkpoints like Jump king or pogostuck.

Jump from red platform to red platform to retrieve your briefcase at your desk at the top of the building, but be careful because if you fall you will have to restart your climb.

Controls:
hold W to jump
hold A to move left (only when in the air)
hold D to move right (only when in the air)

Things to fix: 
unable to move if landing in a certain way
Save and load player position
save and update player score according to the highest the player has been
prevent the camera from going below to to the right of the building.
## Implementation
Built using Godot 3.3.3

The player sprite adapted from MV Platformer Male by MoikMellah. CC0 Licensed.
